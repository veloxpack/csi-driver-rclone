# Basic metrics setup: Only enables metrics on the DaemonSet (no Service, ServiceMonitor, or Dashboard)
# This is the minimal overlay. For more complete setups, see:
# - metrics-service/       : Adds Service to expose metrics
# - metrics-prometheus/    : Adds Service + ServiceMonitor for Prometheus Operator
# - metrics-dashboard/     : Adds only Grafana Dashboard ConfigMap
# - metrics-full/          : Complete setup (Service + ServiceMonitor + Dashboard)
#
# To customize metrics configuration:
# 1. Copy deploy/components/metrics-custom/ to your own directory
# 2. Modify the metrics-patch.yaml file
# 3. Reference your custom component instead of metrics-basic
